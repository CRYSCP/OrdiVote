## **Introduction**

  The proposed system is designed to be a decentralized platform for community decision-making, where users can vote on important issues and proposals. The platform leverages the security and immutability of Bitcoin's blockchain and the programmability of the Stacks network's smart contracts to create a transparent and secure platform.

**Ordinals Inscriptions**

  Bitcoin's ordinals inscriptions provide a powerful tool for creating unique identifiers for each proposal and vote. The system uses ordinals inscriptions to create a unique identifier for each proposal and vote. This identifier is used to ensure the integrity of the voting process, as each vote is linked to a specific proposal. The ordinals inscriptions are stored on the Bitcoin blockchain, ensuring the immutability and security of the identifier.

**Stacks Network (STX)**

The Stacks network provides a powerful tool for creating smart contracts that can execute the results of community voting. The system uses the Stacks network to create smart contracts that automatically distribute rewards and execute the results of community voting. These smart contracts are executed on the Stacks blockchain, ensuring the transparency and security of the voting process.

## **Technical Details**

Bitcoin ordinals is a unique technology that allows data to be permanently embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain using a simple numbering system. The numbering system is based on the principle of ordinal numbers, which are used to indicate the position of a number in a sequence. In the proposed system, the power of Bitcoin ordinals is leveraged to create a decentralized voting platform that is transparent, secure, and immutable. Each vote is assigned a unique ordinal number that corresponds to its position in the voting sequence. This ensures that the votes are tamper-proof and cannot be manipulated.

In addition, the Stacks network is used to create smart contracts that automate the distribution of rewards to the voters. Stacks is a layer-1 blockchain that is built on top of the Bitcoin network, which allows for the creation of smart contracts that can interact with the Bitcoin blockchain. By leveraging Stacks, a decentralized system is created that is fast, secure, and scalable.

## **Use Cases**

The proposed system has a wide range of use cases, including:

- Decentralized Governance: The system can be used to create a decentralized governance system for organizations, communities, and even countries. By using the platform, these entities can make decisions through a transparent, secure, and immutable voting process.

- Decentralized Finance (DeFi): The platform can also be used to create DeFi applications that allow users to vote on various proposals, such as the addition of new tokens to a decentralized exchange, the allocation of funds to a specific project, or the creation of a new governance structure.
Decentralized decision-making for political parties: The system could be used to create a transparent and secure voting process for political parties. Members could vote on important policy decisions, party leadership positions, and other issues, ensuring that the decision-making process is democratic and fair.

- Decentralized decision-making for corporations: The system could also be used by corporations to make important decisions in a transparent and democratic way. Shareholders could vote on issues such as executive compensation, board appointments, and other key decisions, ensuring that the interests of all stakeholders are taken into account.

- Decentralized decision-making for universities: The system could be used by universities to make important decisions related to governance, funding, and academic policies. Faculty, staff, and students could all have a say in the decision-making process, creating a more democratic and inclusive system.

- Decentralized decision-making for communities: The system could be used by communities to make important decisions related to public projects, budget allocations, and other issues. Residents could vote on proposals and have a say in how their community is run, creating a more participatory and democratic system.

- Decentralized decision-making for NGOs: The system could be used by NGOs to make important decisions related to project funding, leadership positions, and other key issues. Members could vote on proposals and ensure that decisions are made in a transparent and democratic way.

## **Tokenomics**

The system will have a native token, which will be used to incentivize users to participate in the voting process. The token will be distributed through a fair launch, ensuring that all users have an equal opportunity to obtain the token. The token will also be used to pay for transaction fees on the platform. A portion of the transaction fees will be burned, reducing the total supply of the token and increasing its value over time. The total supply of ORV will be 100 million tokens, which will be distributed as follows:

- 60% of tokens will be distributed through a community rewards program, where users can earn tokens by participating in the voting process, staking ORV, and contributing to the platform's development.
- 20% of tokens will be allocated to the team and advisors, with a vesting period of 4 years.
- 10% of tokens will be reserved for future development and marketing efforts.
- 10% of tokens will be allocated for strategic partnerships and ecosystem development.
In addition to the community rewards program, users can also earn ORV by providing liquidity to the ORV/ETH pair on decentralized exchanges. This will help increase liquidity and trading volume for the ORV token. Additionally, ORV holders will have governance rights, allowing them to vote on proposals and decisions related to the platform's development and future direction.

### **veTokenomics**

veTokenomics is a unique system that allows users to lock up their tokens for a specified period, usually up to four years. In return for this commitment, users receive veTokens that are non-transferable however it allows users to receive a share of the revenue generated and can be used to boost rewards in our farming programs as well as reducing inflation rates, among other benefits.

By offering veTokenomics, we are creating a strong incentive for users to hold onto their tokens for an extended period, which helps to stabilize our system's value and reduce price volatility. At the same time, this system helps to ensure that our farming programs remain robust and incentivize users to engage with our platform on an ongoing basis.

One of the most significant benefits of veTokenomics is that it enables us to reduce inflation rates in a sustainable way. By incentivizing users to hold onto their tokens, we can limit the supply of tokens in circulation, which helps to stabilize the token's value over time. This is especially important in the context of voting, where users need to have confidence that their vote is not being undermined by token price fluctuations.

Another benefit of veTokenomics is that it helps to promote the long-term growth and success of our platform. By incentivizing users to hold onto their tokens, we are creating a community of committed stakeholders who are invested in our platform's success. This can lead to increased engagement, higher levels of participation in our voting processes, and a stronger sense of community among our users.

The more veTokens a user stakes, the higher their power will be, and the greater their share of the revenue generated by the platform will be.

The locking and stake process also helps to reduce inflation on the platform by encouraging users to hold their ORV tokens instead of selling them. This is because when users stake their ORV, they become non-transferable (veORV) for a predetermined period, usually up to four years. This reduces the supply of VeTokens available for trading, which can help to increase their value.

The release of veTokens happens gradually over time, according to a predetermined schedule. As more time passes, more veTokens are released into circulation. However, the total supply of veTokens will never exceed the predetermined maximum supply.

Users can claim their ORV tokens after the locking period has ended. Once the locking period is over, the staked veTokens become transferable, and users can claim them through a simple process. This allows users to earn rewards and participate in the protocol while still having the ability to access their veTokens at a later date.

In summary, veTokenomics is designed to incentivize users to hold their tokens and contribute to the platform by locking and staking them. This helps to reduce inflation, increase the value of ORV, and provides users with a share of the revenue generated by the platform. The release of veTokens is gradual, and users can claim them after the locking period has ended. Therefore veTokenomics is an essential feature for our farming programs. By allowing users to boost their farming rewards with veTokens, we can create a more dynamic and engaging farming experience that encourages users to participate in our platform on an ongoing basis.

Overall, we believe that VeTokenomics is an essential feature for the long-term success and sustainability of our platform. By offering users a range of benefits for holding onto their tokens, we can create a strong and committed community of users who are invested in our platform's success. 

## **Development Roadmap**
We have a clear development roadmap that outlines the features and improvements we plan to implement over time. Our first priority is to develop the core voting system and launch the ORV token. Once the token is live, we will focus on building partnerships with other projects in the ecosystem and expanding the platform's user base. Our long-term goal is to create a vibrant community of ORV holders who are actively engaged in the voting process and contribute to the platform's growth.

## **Conclusion**

The proposed decentralized voting platform offers a transparent, secure, and immutable solution for community decision-making. By leveraging the power of Bitcoin's blockchain and the programmability of the Stacks network's smart contracts, the platform offers a decentralized and scalable solution that can be used by a wide range of entities, from small community organizations to large nations. With the ability to create unique identifiers for each vote and proposal, and the automatic execution of smart contracts, the platform ensures a tamper-proof and efficient voting process. The proposed system has the potential to revolutionize the way communities make important decisions and offers a decentralized alternative to traditional voting systems.
